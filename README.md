## 🚧 Potential Obstacles & Mitigation

We aim for **2–4 hours per week** per member.

## ⚖️ Workload Expectations

While some may contribute more at times due to task load, we aim to keep responsibilities fair. Members can pick up additional tasks only when completed with their own.

---

## 🚨 Handling Team Issues

If someone is not meeting commitments:
1. Contact via Discord to understand the issue
2. Adjust dependencies so progress isn’t blocked
3. Redistribute tasks if needed

We value communication and transparency.
